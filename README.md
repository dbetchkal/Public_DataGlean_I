# Public_DataGlean_I
## A tool to glean useful numeric results that are 'locked up' in a plot

From a static plot:
 - we define the Y, then X range bounds with the mouse, then...
 - we give the bounds numeric values with the keyboard, then...
 - we glean multiple (x,y) series with the mouse, 
 - writing each series to a JSON file.

To use, download this repository. Save an image file (if necessary, scaling so that dimensions are less than 1000x1000 px.)
Change the `path` variable, and press *Run*. Follow the directions in the console.
